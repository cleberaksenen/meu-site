										<h1>COVID-19 - variants of concern</h1>

									</header>
									<p>The relentless emergence of highly competent strains of SARS-CoV-2 <strong><span style="color:#189ad3;">(Variants of Concern (VOCs))</span></strong>, has unleashed a devastating impact on the ongoing pandemic. These variants exhibit alarming characteristics, including enhanced transmissibility, heightened virulence, and more ability to evade the immune system. Among them, <strong><span style="color:#189ad3;">VOC Delta (B.1.617-2 like)</span></strong> has emerged as a formidable adversary, rapidly establishing dominance across multiple countries worldwide. While its epidemiological significance in fueling the transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil during 2021 cannot be undermined. Its impact on the overall caseload remains comparatively smaller when contrasted with other variants.</p>

									<p>Based on the genomic sequencing data, provided by <strong><span style="color:#189ad3;">Fiocruz Ceara's Genomic Surveillance</span></strong>, a designated period of Delta VOC predominance was identified for conducting the analyses. In this project, comprehensive molecular diagnostic data, along with pertinent information such as collection date, age, sex, race, and vaccination records, were meticulously gathered from the esteemed <strong><span style="color:#189ad3;">"Hemocentro do Ceará (HEMOCE)"</span></strong>. R language was employed for rigorous statistical analyses, comparing the positive group for COVID-19 with complete diagnostic data during the prevalence of the Delta VOC in Ceará.</p>

									<p>Through the conducted analyses, notable observations emerged. Diagnosed patients were found to be relatively older in comparison to undiagnosed individuals. Surprisingly, the female cohort exhibited fewer positive cases than anticipated, considering the number of women tested. Conversely, the male group displayed a higher-than-expected number of positive cases relative to the number of men tested. Additionally, the group consisting of self-declared white individuals presented a higher incidence of positive cases than initially projected, given the overall number of individuals tested. Encouragingly, a significant majority of the analyzed population had received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination during the studied period. The profile of Delta VOC carriers showed statistical differences, related to both sexes, the race of patients considered white and age. Vaccination data corroborated Delta's initial idea that it did not generate an epidemic wave due to the majority of the population being vaccinated. More studies should be carried out to seek a better understanding of this scenario and the influence of other variants.</p>
